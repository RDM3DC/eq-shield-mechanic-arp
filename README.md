# Shielding Mechanism Law (ARP)

**ID:** `eq-shield-mechanic-arp`  
**Tier:** derived  
**Score:** 63  
**Units:** OK  
**Theory:** PASS-WITH-ASSUMPTIONS  

## Equation

$$
E_{eff}=(1-\lambda)E_{ext},\ \ J_{adapt}=\sigma E_{ext},\ \ 0<\lambda<1
$$

## Description

Proposes a shielding effect in ARP systems, modeled as a fractional reduction of the external field. The effective field is E_eff = (1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â»)E_ext, while the induced adaptive current follows J_adapt = ÃƒÂÃ†â€™E_ext, with 0 < ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â» < 1.
